## 📌 Task 1 - Fake News Detection

### 📝 Project Description
Fake news has become one of the biggest challenges in the digital era.  
This project is a **Machine Learning model** integrated with a **Streamlit web app** that predicts whether a news headline or article is **Real** or **Fake**.  

The app preprocesses the text (stopwords removal + stemming) and classifies it using a trained model.
